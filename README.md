# Predicting-single-gene-genetic-disorder
This project aims to try and predict single-gene genetic disorders.
This prediction model was developed as part of our second-semester independent project. All the work done on this dataset usually focuses on predicting all genetic disorders. We wanted to train a model that can predict if a patient suffers from single-gene genetic disorders or not. 
We took the whole dataset and extracted those patient details who had single-gene genetic disorder and trained or model based on that data.
As the data wasn't enough to train the model, the accuracy of model is lower than expected. In future, we hope to increase accuracy as research continues on genetic disorder and more data is discovered.
